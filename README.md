# 📝 Todo Application

A simple and interactive Todo Application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This app allows users to **add, delete, and mark tasks as completed**, and also ensures
that the tasks are **saved using LocalStorage**, so they remain even after refreshing the page.

## 🚀 Features

 **Add new todo items**
 **Mark tasks as completed** using checkboxes
 **Delete unwanted tasks**
 **Save all todos to LocalStorage**
 **Load saved todos automatically on page reload**


---

## How It Works

### 1. Add Todo  
Users enter text in the input box and click **Add** to create a new todo item.

### 2. Mark as Completed  
Clicking the checkbox adds a `checked` style to the label.

### 3. Delete Todo  
Clicking the delete icon removes the item from the UI and updates the list.

### 4. Save Todos  
Clicking the **Save** button stores the updated todo list in LocalStorage.

### 5. Persistent Storage  
On page reload, the app loads todos directly from LocalStorage.
